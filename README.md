# P3_ME193
# Solving Third Order ODE
My motivation for this was to incorporate some of what we have done in my ME 31 course with solving ODEs. My favorite math subject is also differential equations so I wanted to go ahead and solve a (relatively) higher order ODE, so a third order seemed appropriate and feasible.
